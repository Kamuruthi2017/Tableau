You can view my Tableau dashboard online at or open the file NYC 201903 NYC Bike Data.twbx from this repo. 
How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period? Since Tableau Public edition only allows for 1M rows, and my laptop was having trouble with large files, I decided to take a subset of data from the CSV files published on the Citi Bike Data webpage.  I worked with March 2019 subset of data and from that determined that the trips recorded for that period was 23.606 trips.
By what percentage has total ridership grown? I sought to determine the percentage of riders over the days of the week with Friday having the highest percentage growth of 28.45%.  
How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed? Working with a week's data, subscribers tend to have a significant increase with the lowest percentage of 87% relative to the customers whose highest percentage was slightly above 12%. 
What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? Unfortunately,you are not able to determine this from the subset of data I used. However, for the month of March the peak hours for bike usage was around 8am in the morning and 6pm in the evening. 
What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?Unfortunately,you are not able to determine this from the subset of data I used. However, for the month of March the peak hours for bike usage was around 8am in the morning and 6pm in the evening.  
Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?) See the chart NYC 201903 Bike Data | Top 10 End Stations for the list of top 10.  
Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?) See the chart  NYC 201903 Bike Data | Bottom 10 Start Stations which shows the stations with the fewest starting trips.  
Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?) See the chart NYC 201903 Bike Data | Bottom 10 End Stations which shows the stations with the fewest ending trips.
Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)? See the chart NYC 201903 Bike Data  | Gender breakdown which further shows a breakdown too by Usertype whether customer or subscriber.
How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan? I was not able to determine this from the subset of data collected.  
How does the average trip duration change by age? See the chart NYC 201903 Bike Data | Average Trip Duration by Age
What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?  See the chart NYC 201903 Bike Data | Average Trip Duration by Bike ID 
Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?  I was not able to determine this from the subset of data collected. 
How variable is the utilization by bike ID?  I was not able to determine this from the subset of data collected. 
Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:  
A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top. See the maps on sheet Map for Start Stations and MAp for End Station with Zipcode and population numbers respectively|
